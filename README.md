This repo contains the following apps that demonstrate use of the [Google Places SDK for Android](https://developers.google.com/places/android-sdk/):

1. [demo-kotlin](demo-kotlin) Kotlin demo app for the Places SDK.
2. [demo-java](demo-java) Java demo app for the Places SDK.

Note that each folder contains a distinct sample and must be imported separately. Each project also contains two Gradle product flavors:

1. `gms`: Product flavor for samples using the Places SDK that uses Maps SDK for Android 
2. `v3`: Product flavor for samples using the Places SDK that uses Maps SDK V3 BETA for Android

Additionally, the [snippets](snippets) app contains code snippets used for documentation found in https://developers.google.com/places/android-sdk

Getting Started
---------------

These demos use the Gradle build system.

First download the demos by cloning this repository or downloading an archived snapshot. (See the options on the right hand side.)

In Android Studio, use the "Open an existing Android Studio project", and select one of the demo directories (`demo-kotlin` or `demo-java`).

Alternatively use the `./gradlew build` command to build the project directly.

The demos also require that you add your own API key:
1. [Get an API Key](https://developers.google.com/places/android-sdk/get-api-key).
2. Create a file in the root directory called `secure.properties` (this file should _NOT_ be under version control to protect your API key).
3. Add a single line to `secure.properties` that looks like `PLACES_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY`, where `YOUR_API_KEY` is the API key you obtained in the first step. You can also take a look at `secure.properties.template` as an example.
4. Build and run.
