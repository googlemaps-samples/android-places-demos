# Places UI Kit 3D Sample

This sample demonstrates how to integrate the Places SDK for Android's `PlaceDetailsCompactFragment` with a 3D map view. It allows users to tap on a location on a 3D Google Map to display its details in a compact, embedded view.

## Features

- **3D Google Map**: Utilizes the 3D Maps SDK to display a rich, interactive 3D map.
- **Place Details**: On tapping a location on the map, the app displays the place's details using the `PlaceDetailsCompactFragment`.
- **MVVM Architecture**: Follows the Model-View-ViewModel pattern, with a `MainViewModel` managing the UI state.
- **Location-Aware**: Requests location permissions to center the map on the user's current location.
- **Secrets Management**: Uses the Secrets Gradle Plugin for Android to securely handle the Google Maps API key.

## Requirements

- Android Studio
- An Android device or emulator
- A Google Maps API key

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/googlemaps-samples/android-places-demos.git
    ```
2.  **Open the project in Android Studio:**
    Open the `PlacesUIKit3D` directory in Android Studio.

3.  **Add your API Key:**
    -   Create a file named `secrets.properties` in the root directory of the `PlacesUIKit3D` project (`/Users/dkhawk/AndroidStudioProjects/github-maps-code/android-places-demos/PlacesUIKit3D`).
    -   Add your Google Maps API key to the `secrets.properties` file, making sure that the Maps SDK for Android and the Places API are enabled for the key.
        ```
        MAPS3D_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
        PLACES_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
        ```
    - Note: The `secrets.properties` file is included in the `.gitignore` file to prevent it from being checked into version control.

## Running the Application

Once the project is set up and the API key is added, you can run the application on an Android device or emulator directly from Android Studio.

- The app will request location permissions.
- The map will center on the user's location if permission is granted, otherwise it will default to a location in Colorado.
- Tap on any location on the map to see the Place Details view.
